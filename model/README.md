Work in progress.


I am currently trying to change the used model to build a generative model.
The choice is Seq2Seq without attention and with a default RNN for now. 

However it takes a lot of time and efforts which I cannot afford at the moment.
I am trying to spend as much time as I can but it doesn't move forward enough.

Here is a figma link of some drawing of the chosen architecture: https://www.figma.com/file/kaswiI8nPU7dbI9LuD1HOW/Seq2Seq?node-id=0%3A1
